Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications in a structured and efficient manner. Its importance in the technology industry is that it plays a crucial role in building applications that power businesses, healthcare, finance, and entertainment industries.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s-1960s: The Birth of Software Engineering – Software development was initially unstructured, leading to the term "software crisis" due to project failures.  
1970s-1980s: The Rise of Structured Programming – Methodologies like Waterfall and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) emerged to improve efficiency.  
1990s-Present: Agile and DevOps – Agile development and DevOps practices revolutionized software development by promoting flexibility and continuous integration

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement Analysis – Understanding what the software should do.  
2. Design – Creating blueprints for the software.  
3. Coding – Writing the actual code.  
4. Testing – Identifying and fixing bugs.  
5. Deployment – Releasing the software to users.  
6. Maintenance – Updating and improving the software after release

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In terms of process, Waterfall has a linear and step by step process and agile has a more flexible process.
It's hard to make changes in waterfall while changes in agile are easier to incorporate.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Writes and maintains code.  
Quality Assurance Engineer – Tests the software to ensure it works correctly. 
Project Manager – Oversees the project, ensuring deadlines and goals are met.  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) help developers write and debug code efficiently such as Visual Studio Code.  
VCS (Version Control Systems) track code changes, allowing teamwork and rollback of mistakes such as Git and GitHub.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging Complex Code - Use debugging tools and write clear documentation.  
Meeting Deadlines - Follow Agile methods and use task management tools such as Jira and Trello

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Tests individual components of code.  
Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together.  
System Testing – Tests the whole system as a complete product.  
Acceptance Testing – Ensures the software meets user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing clear and specific instructions to effectively interact with AI models like ChatGPT. It is important because well-structured prompts improve AI responses, making them more useful and accurate.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Tell me about cars.  
Improved Prompt: Explain the differences between electric and gasoline cars, including their advantages and disadvantages

The improved prompt is better more specific hence will lead to a more detailed and relevant answer.
